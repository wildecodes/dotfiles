# My Pretty Dank Dotfiles

* I did not originate these dotfiles, but I've tweaked them a lot over time. 
I'm very grateful for my programmer friends and other brilliant people who've
shared with me their knowledge and other tips from the road, and I try to give
credit where due. These will continue to evolve as I learn, I hope you will find
something useful to you.

* The bulk of the credit for my `.bash_prompt` goes to [twolfson](https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt).
I merely adapted and tweaked it a bit. Also the git branching magic is not mine.


# Wait though... what?

* Config files for the default terminal (`bash`) on most \*nix systems are found 
in the home directory, aka `~`
* Download the file and save it to `~/`
* Require it by copying and pasting `.~/.bash_prompt` at the top of your 
`.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` files (also found in `~/`) 

* FYI you might want to change the color settings in your terminal emulator
to make the prompt easier to read, for example, by using a dark background color.
* Enjoy! d^\_^b
