# Keith's Awesome Dotfiles

* These are not mostly my creation, I'm very grateful to have had
programmer friends and other brilliant people help me cobble together
some really useful configuration files.

* Furthermore the bulk of the credit
for my bash_prompt goes to [twolfson](https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt).
I merely adapted and tweaked it a bit. Also the git branching magic is not mine.

* I'm posting this here because it has been very helpful to me and I hope
it will be helpful to you. Someday you'll pay it forward.

# What am I supposed to do with this?

* Config files on most \*nix systems are found in the home directory, aka `~`
* Download the file and save it to `~/`
* Require it by copying and pasting `.~/.bash_prompt` at the top of your 
.bashrc or .bash_profile files (also found in `~/`) 

* FYI you might want to change the color settings in your terminal emulator
to make the prompt easier to read, which you can do typing `âŒ˜ +,`
* Enjoy! d^\_^b

# To my classmates at App Academy:

* If this takes you more than 5 minutes to figure out, don't waste time on it.
It's not mission critical. Study for the Assessment and I can help you tweak it
Monday evening after class.
