# Keith's Awesome Dotfiles

* These are not mostly my creation, I'm very grateful to have had
programmer friends and other brilliant people help me cobble together
some really useful configuration files.

* Furthermore the bulk of the credit
for my bash_prompt goes to (twolfson)[https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt].
I merely adapted and tweaked it a bit. Also the git branching magic is not mine.

* I'm posting this here because it has been very helpful to me and I hope
it will be helpful to you. Someday you'll pay it forward.
